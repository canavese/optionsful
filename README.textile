h2. TODO & WHISH-LIST
* -Make the installation easier.-
* Create tests! (Oh no! Psst! Don't tell anyone!)
* Research if there are means to know whether formats (types) each one of available methods can accept and serve - WHY NOT make use of BRUTE FORCE? 8-D - We Will Rock You approach - IT WILL BE ANOTHER PROJECT?
* Provide on demand human readable documentation (maybe attribute oriented programming) hopefully supporting the _about to be given_ @Link@ HTTP header 
* -Implement instrumentation, logging - (really needed?)-
* -Research if there are means to test authorization, if Authorization header provided in the request- OUT_OF_SCOPE

* Platform: ruby 1.8.7, rails 2.3.8, rack 1.2.1

h2. CONTRIBUTORS
